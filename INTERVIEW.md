DSA Coding Interview
====================

1. __*CLARIFICATION*__
   * Read / repeat the question out loud
   * Discover all constraints
     - Give a minimal amount of concise examples
     - Document them with short phrases
     - As little as possible; As much as necessary
2. __*APPROACH*__
   * Propose high-level solution(s)
     - Determine brute force / naive time & space complexity
     - Work toward an optimal solution (would interviewer prefer space efficiency traded out for better time?)
     - Think out loud the entire time
     - Get buy-in from interviewer
3. __*IMPLEMENTATION*__
   * Implement the agreed upon solution
     - Ask permission before writing _any_ code
     - Include / import all external dependencies
     - Use good naming (not too short, not too long)
     - Use appropriate helper functions (ie. break into sub-problems)
     - Comment inline code for later reviewers
     - Think out loud the entire time
   * Test code
     - Dry run at least one example -- using comments to track state
     - Consider edge cases
     - Consider error cases
     - Continue speaking out loud the entire time
