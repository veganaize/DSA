DSA Coding Interview
====================

_Think out loud the entire time -- even when stuck!_


1. __*CLARIFICATION*__
   * Read / repeat the question out loud
   * Discover all constraints:
     - Give a minimal amount of concise examples
     - Document them with short phrases
     - As little as possible; As much as necessary
   * Input(s) & output:
     - Minimum & maximum
       - Length
       - Element size
       - Negative values?
       - Floating point?
       - Empty?
     - Presorted?
     - Duplicates?
     - Types:
       - Nulls?
       - Unicode?
     - Format:
       - Array?
       - Mapping?
       - Linked list?
       - Tree?
2. __*APPROACH*__
   * Propose high-level solution(s)
     - Determine brute force / naive time & space complexity
     - Work toward an optimal solution (would interviewer prefer space efficiency traded out for better time?)
     - State time & space complexities
     - Get buy-in from interviewer
3. __*IMPLEMENTATION*__
   * Implement the agreed upon solution
     - Ask permission before writing _any_ code
     - Include / import all external dependencies
     - Write clean code:
       - Comment inline code blocks for later reviewers
       - Use good naming (not too short, not too long)
       - Consistent whitespace / indentation
       - Use appropriate helper functions:
         - Keep code DRY
         - Break into sub-problems
   * Test code
     - Don't say it's "done" until absolutely sure it's error free & runs properly
     - Dry run at least one example -- using comments to track state
     - Consider edge cases
     - Consider error cases
     - Fix bugs on the fly
